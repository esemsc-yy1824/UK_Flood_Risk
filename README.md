## Synopsis
Given the global and UK distribution of human habitation, flooding is one of the most common and impactful natural distasters which can occur. [Analysis of satellite data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w) coupled with [predictions on future changes](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/) to the climate suggest this is an issue which will only get more frequent and severe.

Flooding can occur from a number of sources:

- Surface water (from rainfall run-off, or from the fresh or dirty water systems)
- Rivers, due to blockage or excess rainfall
- Seas, due to sea level rise or storm surge.

Currently flood risk from these sources in the UK is assessed in a number of ways using topographic data, large, complex numerical models and a great degree of human experience. It would be useful to have rapid tools leveraging ML teachniques to update these risk assessments in piecemeal as new data is obtained.

## Purpose
The purpose of this programme is to:

  **(a) Develop ML prediction routines for flood probability and visualise their impact on the UK.**
  
  **(b) Use this tool, along with rainfall and river level data, to provide a holistic visual tool for assessing and analyzing flood risk.**

## Quick Start ‚ú®
**Run these commands in the terminal to create a new Conda environment and install all the necessary dependencies:**

```
cd UK_Flood_Risk
conda create -n flood python=3.9
conda activate flood
conda env update -f environment.yml
```
### Run the prediction model:
`python run_model.py`

### Result Visualization:
- You can view the visualizations through the project's Jupyter Notebook:  
__./Data Visualization.ipynb__  
- or interact directly by running our webpage:  
 `streamlit run WebPage.py`
